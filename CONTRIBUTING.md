# Contribute to Heliblocks
I really appreciate your interest to contribute to Heliblocks! Any kind of contribution is highly appreciated, not only coding ☺️.

## Translation contributions
To contribute you just need to open from github, edit and submit the changes, I use markdown to write the documentation so you don't need to know code [documentation](https://github.com/goiblas/Heliblocks-App/edit/master/src/pages/documentation/docs-en.js)
